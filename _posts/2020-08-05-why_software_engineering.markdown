I was never really a school person. Well, atleast not with the schools I've encountered. The whole idea of standardized education is not for me, I did well in it, but the fufillment of being educated never came. I realized this during my sophomore year in college. I left school and never looked back, never felt like I was missing anything either.

I started to really tinker with coding and tech when I became a phone tech. I had so much fun taking phones and devices I started looking into what made the software tick. I soon realized that coding is like trying to fill an unfillable cup. There's always something new, someway to do thing better, something new to learn all the time. Software Engineering lets me learn and better myself in a new way I didnt think would ever happen.
